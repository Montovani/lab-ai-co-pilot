🏆 My Pick:
Claude

✅ Pros & Cons
ChatGPT
✅ Big explanation using good analogies to understand
❌ Too big the answer

Claude
✅ Well detailed explained and also I like the visualisation of the code it sent in the comments.
❌ It showed some part of the code that was not part of it.

Gemini
✅ Direct to the point
❌ It should show more examples or explained in a easier way.

📌 Task-by-Task Highlights
Task 1: Chat GPT explained better, but the other ones was not that behind
Task 2: I liked more Gemini and Claude where they showed 
Task 3: Claude showed a better and consistent version of the optimized code.

🔍 Surprises & Bugs
In the last task Gemini overcomplicated the result 

Final Thoughts
Which AI would you trust in a real project? Why?
I think for code claude did a pretty good job. For learn concepts I think gpt is better because it explains in a easy way to understand. But for create things and also debug or creating code Claude is better
